# Build Instructions
The main branch is the stable branch, however if you plan on modifying this I advise you fork the dev branch.

In order to build you need Visual Studio 2019(obviously) and use github desktop or download the source directly.

Once the source is downloaded:

Create a folder called "Dependecies" where the solution is and copy all of the content from the BALDI_DATA/Managed folder to it, then copy all of the bepinex/core dll files from your bepinex 5.4 installation in there as well.

Bam you should be able to just compile it now, if not create an issue or something.
